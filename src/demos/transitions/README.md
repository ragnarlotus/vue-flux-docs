# Transitions

Here you can find all transitions included with a demo, playground and the source.

Watch out because most of the transitions become hypnotic and result very funny.

::: tip

Don't forget to see both directions, because most of the transitions have a different effect depending on the direction.

:::

I personally recommend playing with:

- round 2 also has a pretty effect playing with the rotation x value
- warp in previous direction, because looks like a kaleidoscope, amazing!
- wave has a great effect and feels even relaxing in slow motion
- zip results beautiful when the next image starts appearing
