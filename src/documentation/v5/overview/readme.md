      FluxPagination
   },

   data: () => ({
      fluxOptions: {
         autoplay: true
      },
      fluxImages: [ 'URL1', 'URL2', 'URL3' ],

      }
   })
}
```

## Performance

Weight is just 111KB so is pretty light having only the essential CSS. It also does not require a high end computer as animations are performed with CSS3 hardware acceleration.
