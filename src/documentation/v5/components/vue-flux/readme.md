## Description

This is the main component of the slider and will be the view that display the images.

## Component

The slider preloads all images to make transitions smooth, so depending on size and quantity of images can take a while to begin.

The component is build as a container, having a mask that renders and display the images. The mask contains the transition component and two FluxImages that are used to be shown before and after transitions.

In touchable screens you can slide right and left to show previous or next image. Will also display index if defined sliding up.

The component has the following attributes.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| options | Object | false | An object containing the slider options |
| transitions | Object | true | An object defined with the wanted transitions |
| transitionOptions | Object | false | The options for each transition |
| path | string | false | Base path of the images |
| images | Array | false | An array with the images URL |
| captions | Array | false | An array with captions to be displayed on each image |

Example:

``` html
<vue-flux
   :options="fluxOptions"
   :images="fluxImages"
   :transitions="fluxTransitions"
   :captions="fluxCaptions"
   ref="slider">
</vue-flux>

<button @click="$refs.slider.show('next')">NEXT</button>
```

## Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| autoplay | Boolean | false | Autoplay images when loaded |
| fullscreen | Boolean | false | Allows the slider to be displayed in full screen |
| enableGestures | Boolean | false | Define if in touchable screens should show control and index icons or use gestures |
| infinite | Boolean | true | The slider will start over when reaches the last image, otherwise will stop |
| bindKeys | Boolean | false | Binds the arrow keys to show next or previous |
| delay | Integer | 5000 | The time in ms that an image will be displayed before changing to next |
| autohideTime | Integer | 1500 | The time in ms that the controls and index button will stay until disappear. If set to 0 they will never disappear |
| width | string | 100% | Defines the slider width |
| height | string | auto | Defines the slider height |

## Size

The slider size is defined the following way.

If width and height are passed in options, that size will prevail over all.

By default the width will be the parents width and height will be auto.

If the height is auto, it will check if the slider has a defined CSS with height, if not will check the parent, otherwise will calculate the height using the width as per 16:9 ratio.

## Transitions

This is an object that will own the transitions to be used between images. The object is build using the transition name and its component.

The transitions will be run in the order defined and then will begin again from the first.

The transitions have a direction being 'right' by default and using 'left' when next image is previous so different transitions can be run depending on direction.

Slider will ignore any interaction while a transition is running.

Refer to [Transitions](../transitions/) to know more about included transitions.

Example:

``` js
import { VueFlux, Transitions } from 'vue-flux';

let fluxTransitions: {
   transitionFade: Transitions.transitionFade,
   transitionBook: Transitions.transitionBook,
   transitionBlocks2: Transitions.transitionBlocks2
}
```

## Transition options

This is an object with the options that will overwrite the default of transitions.

Example:

``` js
let transitionOptions: {
   transitionFade: {
      totalDuration: 500,
      easing: 'ease'
   },
   transitionBlocks2d2: {
      rows: 5,
      cols: 5,
      tileDelay: 150
   }
}
```

## Path

Is the base path of the images. For example if all the images are located in /img/slide/example you can set it and then in the images array just use the file names.

## Images

The array containing the image URLs to be displayed.

If an image can not be loaded will be omitted displaying a console warning message.
