# Resources

This are the resources that the slider supports.

Each resource has 2 component properties, one is used during the transitions, and the other to display. This is done this way because for some resources like videos, can't make transitions, so they use an image for the transition and when it ends it switches the image to the video to be displayed.

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [image](image) | Displays an image |
| [video](video) | Displays a video |
| [Component](component) | Displays vue component |
