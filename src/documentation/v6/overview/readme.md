## Quick start

Install and save the package.

``` bash
npm install --save vue-flux@stable
```

Add the component to the template. This one has all the complements, so you can remove the ones you don't want.

``` html
<vue-flux
   :options="vfOptions"
   :images="vfImages"
   :transitions="vfTransitions"
   :captions="vfCaptions"
   ref="slider">

   <template v-slot:preloader>
      <flux-preloader />
   </template>

   <template v-slot:caption>
      <flux-caption />
   </template>

   <template v-slot:controls>
      <flux-controls />
   </template>

   <template v-slot:pagination>
      <flux-pagination />
   </template>

   <template v-slot:index>
      <flux-index />
   </template>
</vue-flux>

<button @click="$refs.slider.show('next')">NEXT</button>
```

Add it to the component, and like before you can remove the complements you don't use.

``` javascript
import {
   VueFlux,
   FluxCaption,
   FluxControls,
   FluxIndex,
   FluxPagination,
   FluxPreloader
} from 'vue-flux';

export default {
   components: {
      VueFlux,
      FluxCaption,
      FluxControls,
      FluxIndex,
      FluxPagination,
      FluxPreloader,
   },

   data: () => ({
      vfOptions: {
         autoplay: true
      },
      vfImages: [ 'URL1', 'URL2', 'URL3' ],
      vfTransitions: [ 'fade', 'cube', 'book', 'wave' ],
      vfCaptions: [
         'Caption for image 1',
         'Caption for image 2',
         'Caption for image 3',
      ],
   }),
}
```

## Performance

Weight is about 130 KB so is pretty light having only the essential CSS. It also does not require a high end computer as animations are performed with CSS3 hardware acceleration.

## Included transitions

#### 2D transitions

* Fade: fades from one image to next.
* Kenburn: fades, zoom and moves current image to next.
* Swipe: swipes the image to display next like uncovered with a curtain.
* Slide: slides the image horizontally revealing the next.
* Waterfall: divides the image in bars and drops them down in turns.
* Zip: divides the image in bars and slides them up and down alternately like a zip.
* Blinds 2D: divides the image in vertical bars that blinds and fades out.
* Blocks 1: the image is split in blocks that shrink and fade out randomly.
* Blocks 2: the image is split in blocks that shrink and fade out in wave from a corner to the opposite.
* Concentric: a concentric effect is performed by rotating the image converted into circles.
* Warp: a concentric effect is performed by rotating the image converted into circles in alternate direction.
* Camera: from outside to inside the image is being circled in black like a camera.

#### 3D transitions

* Cube: turns the image to a side like if place in a cube.
* Book: makes the effect of turning a page to display next image.
* Fall: the image falls in front displaying next image.
* Wave: makes the image 3D and divides it in slices that turn vertically to display the next image.
* Blinds 3D: divides the image in vertical bars that blinds 180 deg to form the next image.
* Round 1: the image is split in blocks that turn 180 deg horizontally to form next image.
* Round 2: panels start to round vertically revealing the next image in upper arrow form leaving trail.
* Explode: the image starts to explode from the center to outside.

## Parallax

As simple as this.

``` html
<flux-parallax src="url" style="height: 300px;">
   <div>CONTENT</div>
</flux-parallax>
```
